This is the final project from the Section 2 in the Learn Ruby on Rails By Building Projects course located [here](https://www.eduonix.com/dashboard/Learn-Ruby-on-Rails-By-Building-Projects)

Everything here is for learning purpose.

For the application i'm using:
    [Slim](https://github.com/slim-template/slim) to HTML,
    [Slim-Rails](https://github.com/slim-template/slim-rails) to auto generate .slim files while scaffolding,
    [SCSS](https://github.com/rails/sass-rails "SCSS") to css;
    [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) to install [BootStrap 3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) with [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) to improve the front-end.
